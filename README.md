## 🧠 Overview

**Star Citizen Launcher Customizer** is a **Python-based application** that empowers users to personalize and modify the *Star Citizen* game launcher interface.  

The project is currently **under active development (WIP)** — the **core system is fully functional**, while the **UX/UI** is still being refined for better usability and aesthetics.

This tool focuses on flexibility and creative freedom, allowing every **color** in the launcher UI to be customized.  
In the future, users will also be able to personalize **images**, **videos**, and **audio** elements on the main launcher screen.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

The project is **entirely written in Python**, following a **multi-class, modular structure** for scalability and maintainability.

### 🧩 Core Technologies

- **GUI Frameworks:**
  - [`tkinter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) & [`customtkinter`](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter) for a modern, theme-aware interface.

- **Architecture:**
  - Multi-class object-oriented design ensuring modularity and clean separation of concerns.

- **Logging Service:**
  - Integrated **logging system** for streamlined debugging and real-time event tracking.

- **File Management:**
  - Persistent project handling system to **save, load, and manage** user configurations.

- **Node.js Integration:**
  - Uses **Node.js** for **`.asar` file extraction**, enabling access and modification of Star Citizen launcher assets.
